# TheGame
Trying to find an optimal strategy for The Game


## Implemented strategies

You can change the strategy of the game by changing the `strategy` variable in thegame.py file. The strategies already implemented are:

- `user_interface`: basic user inter face to play TheGame
- `strategy_simple`: just play the minimum number of cards
- `strategy_n_diff`: play the minimum number of cards + cards with smaller difference than the parameter 'acceptable_difference'
